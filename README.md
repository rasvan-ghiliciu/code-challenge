# Introduction
This project is a full-stack application developed as part of the Blue Rabbit Code Challenge. It features a React-based frontend and a Node.js backend, with JavaScript as the foundational language for both components.

# Technology Stack
  # Frontend: React
Why React?

Component-Based Architecture: React's component-based structure promotes reusable code, making it efficient for developing complex user interfaces.
Strong Community and Ecosystem: React's vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, along with strong community support, offers solutions for virtually any development need.
Efficiency and Performance: The use of a virtual DOM ensures that updates to the UI are fast and efficient, enhancing the overall user experience.
# Backend: Node.js
   Why Node.js?

Single Language Across the Stack: Using JavaScript for both the frontend and backend streamlines development, allowing for a more cohesive and efficient coding process.
Asynchronous Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js excels in handling concurrent connections and I/O-bound tasks, making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance web applications.
NPM Ecosystem: Access to an extensive package registry through NPM enables rapid development with a wide array of tools and libraries at our disposal.
# Language: JavaScript
Why JavaScript?

Versatility: JavaScript's flexibility allows it to run on virtually any platform, from server-side Node.js environments to client-side web browsers.
Community and Resources: Being one of the most popular programming languages, JavaScript has a vast array of learning resources, community forums, and development tools.
Full-Stack Development: JavaScript's ability to operate across the entire stack reduces context switching and simplifies the development process, making it an ideal choice for this project.

# Design Patterns and Architecture
MVC Architecture: The backend is structured around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, facilitating clear separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to manage and scale.
State Management: On the frontend, React's context API and hooks are utilized for state management, ensuring efficient data flow and component reusability across the application.

# Conclusion
Choosing Node.js, React, and JavaScript for this project was driven by considerations of efficiency, scalability, and developer experience. This technology stack not only facilitated rapid development but also ensured that the application could be easily extended and maintained. The challenges encountered during development provided valuable learning experiences, further solidifying my understanding and proficiency in full-stack JavaScript development.




# Blue Rabbit Code Challenge

Fork this repo and create a Full Stack app using languages and frameworks of your choice that 
*literally* introduces you to us. Submit your response back to us here in the form of a pull 
request or submit it to us privately. Please don't spend more than a couple hours on it. It's ok
if you don't finish, just tackle the requirements in order and take it as far as you can in the time frame.

Include A README with instructions on how to build/run the app. Use the README to let us know
why you chose the technologies you did. Notes on design patterns, challenges, or aspects
of your stack that you find interesting are also appreciated!

### Requirements
1. Create an API with an endpoint or operation that we can call that tells us your name. The shape of the data 
and the storage mechanism are up to you. It's ok if it takes no params and returns only your name.
2. Create a minimal frontend that calls your api and displays your name when we run it.
3. Add an API endpoint or operation that takes a name and stores it.
4. Add an input to the frontend that we can use to submit a name to the endpoint or operation you just created.  
5. Add an input to the frontend that lets us upload an image avatar and submit it to your API.
